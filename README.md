- API: Integration with financial APIs to retrieve real-time stock prices, economic indicators, and consumer confidence indices.
- Big Data System: Incorporation of macroeconomic data, such as GDP growth rates, inflation rates, and interest rates, to analyze their impact on consumer spending behavior and market dynamics.

## Financial Performance Analysis:
- Analyze historical financial data to assess the retailer's revenue trends, profit margins, and expense ratios.
- Conduct financial ratio analysis to evaluate liquidity, solvency, and profitability metrics.
- Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) for measuring financial health and operational efficiency.

## Market Research and Competitive Analysis:
- Gather market intelligence by analyzing competitor pricing strategies, market share dynamics, and product offerings.
- Monitor industry trends, consumer preferences, and emerging market opportunities to inform strategic decision-making.
- Forecasting and Scenario Analysis:

## Develop predictive models to forecast sales revenue, demand forecasting, and inventory optimization.
- Perform scenario analysis to evaluate the impact of external factors (e.g., economic downturns, supply chain disruptions) on financial performance and mitigate risks.
- Strategic Planning and Investment Analysis:

## Evaluate investment opportunities, such as store expansion, product diversification, or strategic partnerships, using financial modeling techniques (e.g., net present value analysis, return on investment).
